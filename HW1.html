        <h3>Why I'm Here</h3>
        <p> I'm here taking this class so I can gain more knowledge on how to build websites, make them interactive, and to brush up on skills that I
          haven't been able to consistently use in a long time. Over the last few years, I've been learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python whenever 
          I've been able to find the free time to do so. Recently I just haven't had the time, but I figured taking a class on the subjects will help me
          become more consistent and help retain the information for personal use and for a possible career path in the future.</p>

          <p> My name is Julius. I was born in Orange, California and have lived in Orange County for a majority of my life. Unfortunately, I haven't been outside of California very much, the furthest being Utah to visit Zion National Park.
            Due to that, one of my goals is to travel to every state in the United States at least once. My current hobbies are playing video games, skateboarding, and hiking and traveling to somewhat local places that I haven't been to.
          I'm currently going to school and majoring in Computer Science. I never had the interest in computer science until a few years ago, when miraculously decided that I wanted to learn and dive deep into programming just to see 
        what it was all about. As I started researching more about it and what different programming languages were capable of, it fully grasped my attention and curiosity and I wanted to learn as much as I could immediately. Now, here I am,
      in a place that I feel is a good starting point.</p>
